Morning Wood helps you track your morning wood incidents. It features a simple two-button interface, so adding a new entry to the log takes seconds. The data is then shown in a glanceable calendar view, where you’ll also find information on your current and longest streaks of no incidents.


Morning Wood includes customization options for the home page as well as a dark mode, which you can turn on permanently or set to follow the system theme. You can back up your logs to the cloud with a tap, and the optional fingerprint lock feature ensures that your data stays out of sight.


Morning Wood is an open-source app. You can <a href="">view the source code on GitHub</a> or <a href="">help translate Morning Wood into your language</a>.
